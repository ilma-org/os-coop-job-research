## Turn 1 — user
Read the file [REDACTED:path] and follow its instructions exactly. Read no other file on this machine.

Content of the input file:

You are an independent fact checker. You have no other context.

For each claim below, open its source URL yourself (WebFetch or curl) and decide whether the page supports the claim. Do not read any other file on this machine except this one. Do not look for other sources. Do not guess: if you cannot open a URL, say so.

For each claim, output exactly these five lines:
ID: <id>
VERDICT: supported | partial | unsupported
QUOTE: <one or two sentences copied verbatim from the page that best support the claim. Confirm in code that it is an exact substring of the page text.>
ARCHIVE: loads+quote-present | loads+quote-missing | fails | not-given   (only when an archive URL is listed)
ISSUES: <any wording in the claim that goes beyond what the page says, or: none>

Start your report with one line: MODEL: <your model name and exact model ID as given in your system prompt>.
Write the complete report to [REDACTED:path] and also return the same text as your final answer.
